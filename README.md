# diablo4-build-calculator

A build calculator for [Diablo 4](https://diablo4.blizzard.com).

## Data Sources

> I have a question: where did you get the data from?

It's all datamined from the game directly. You either need a copy of the already-decrypted assets, or a copy of the game and a decryption key to datamine anything useful.

I originally got the [tree data](https://github.com/Lothrik/diablo4-build-calc/tree/master/parser/backup/) from someone else over Discord.

I've been working on datamining everything myself lately as I don't really want to rely on someone else's datamining efforts to keep this calculator working.

> Is it publicly available somewhere or did you put this all together on your own?

No datamining tools are currently publicly available, to the best of my knowledge. I haven't released mine, anyway; and I don't think the guy that sent me those skill tree JSON exports has either.

If for whatever reason I stop working on this build calculator I'll upload the tools I used here.
